This compact tool provides quick and easy calculations for the central tendencies of a dataset.

# Features
Mean Calculation: Input a set of numbers, and the calculator will instantly provide the mean (average) of the dataset.<br><br>
Median Calculation: Enter your data, and the calculator will promptly compute the median, which is the middle value of the sorted dataset.<br><br>
